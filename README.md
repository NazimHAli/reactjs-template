# ReactJS Template

ReactJS starter template/boilerplate using a modern build process with WebPack 5 in TypeScript. All the components are currently functional components, recommend reading about them here [ReactJS Doc](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html#function-and-class-components). One of the primary goals of this repo is to incorporate all the main concepts of ReactJS.
